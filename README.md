üöÄ What This App Does

Interactive map showing 100+ initiatives across 25+ Danish cities
Copenhagen Capacity framework: Organized by their 4 official recommendation categories
Gap analysis mode: Shows cities missing specific recommendations (red markers)
Coverage dashboard: Real-time stats on national/regional implementation
Advanced filtering: By Copenhagen Capacity category or city
Policy insights: Track implementation of official recommendations

üìä The Copenhagen Capacity Framework
Based on the Copenhagen Capacity 2025 Expat Survey, the app tracks implementation of their 4 official recommendations:
1. Job Market Accessibility

Targeted programs for international job seekers
Job portals with relevant jobs

2. International Students

Career services and pathways to employment
Integration resources for students

3. Inclusion and Belonging

Specific onboarding programs for internationals
More social events where internationals and Danes can meet
Encourage cultural engagement opportunities

4. Spouses/Partners & Family

Facilitate job opportunities for accompanying partners
Ensure inclusive education for international children

ü§ñ Built Entirely With AI Collaboration
This project demonstrates the incredible power of AI-assisted policy analysis and rapid application development:
Phase 1: Research ( Perplexity AI)
Used targeted prompts to gather comprehensive data on international talent initiatives across Denmark:
Based on the Copenhagen Capacity 2025 recommendations, I'd like to map which 
Danish municipalities have implemented programs for international talent retention...
The persistence factor: Initial searches focused on major cities, but systematic iteration uncovered comprehensive municipal programs, international schools, and national initiatives across all regions of Denmark.
Phase 2: Application Development (Claude)
Claude built the complete policy tracking platform:

‚úÖ Streamlit application architecture aligned with Copenhagen Capacity framework
‚úÖ Interactive map with color-coded implementation status
‚úÖ Gap analysis functionality to identify policy holes
‚úÖ Coverage dashboard showing implementation by recommendation category
‚úÖ Danish municipal coordinate system and geographic visualization

Phase 3: Advanced Features (Claude + ChatGPT suggestions)
Enhanced with sophisticated policy analysis tools:
üîß Implementation Tracking

Separate visualization layers for different program types
Toggle functionality for focused analysis
Program-specific metadata and organizational details

üìä Policy Gap Analysis

Real-time statistics: "25+ cities covered across 4 recommendation areas"
Systematic identification of implementation gaps
Municipal comparison: "Aarhus addresses all 4 Copenhagen Capacity areas"

‚ö†Ô∏è Strategic Planning Mode

Visual identification of cities missing specific recommendations
Red warning indicators for policy development priorities
Perfect for identifying where Denmark needs targeted investment

Total development time: an hour from concept to comprehensive policy platform
The Human Role (Quality Control & Strategic Direction)

Research strategy: Directing AI to find specific municipal programs and validate data sources
Framework alignment: Ensuring perfect compliance with Copenhagen Capacity's official recommendations
Feature prioritization: Requesting gap analysis and coverage tracking capabilities
Data validation: Verifying program details and organizational responsibilities

üìà Key Policy Insights & Use Cases
For Policymakers:

Use Gap Analysis to identify municipalities needing specific Copenhagen Capacity programs
Track implementation progress across the 4 official recommendation areas
Identify successful models for replication (Aarhus's comprehensive approach)

For Municipal Planners:

Compare your city's programs against Copenhagen Capacity recommendations
Find best practices from similar-sized municipalities
Identify partnership opportunities for international talent retention

For International Families:

Discover cities with comprehensive support across all 4 areas
Find locations with strong spouse/partner employment programs
Identify areas with robust international education options

For Researchers & Policy Analysts:

Analyze patterns in municipal vs. university vs. corporate program delivery
Track systematic implementation of evidence-based policy recommendations
Identify regional variations in international talent retention strategies

Key Discoveries:

Aarhus is the only municipality fully implementing all 4 Copenhagen Capacity areas
International education (4b) has excellent national coverage with 20+ cities
Spouse/partner employment (4a) shows strong but uneven implementation
Social integration (3b, 3c) varies significantly by municipality size
Gap analysis reveals systematic opportunities for targeted policy development

üéØ Technical Architecture

Frontend: Streamlit (rapid policy dashboard development)
Mapping: Folium + streamlit-folium (interactive geographic visualization)
Data Processing: Pandas (municipal program analysis)
Policy Framework: Copenhagen Capacity 2025 Expat Survey alignment
Analytics: Real-time implementation coverage statistics

üìù Data Sources & Methodology
Comprehensive data compiled through AI-assisted research from:

Copenhagen Capacity 2025 Expat Survey (primary framework)
Municipal international strategy documents and websites
University international student services and career programs
Regional job center and EURES service documentation
International school directories and accreditation databases
Corporate expat program case studies and best practices

Data Validation: Cross-referenced multiple sources for each initiative to ensure accuracy of program details, organizational responsibility, and implementation status.
üîÆ Future Policy Development Applications

 Automated monitoring of new municipal program launches
 Impact metrics integration via AI-powered web scraping
 Municipal benchmarking reports generated with GPT analysis
 Multi-language policy recommendations via translation APIs
 Predictive analysis for optimal program placement
 Integration with Danish municipal budget and planning cycles

üåü The AI-Policy Analysis Revolution
This project demonstrates the paradigm shift in evidence-based policy development:

Research acceleration: AI can systematically gather policy implementation data across multiple jurisdictions in minutes rather than months
Framework compliance: Ensures perfect alignment with official policy recommendations without human error
Real-time analysis: Enables continuous monitoring of policy implementation rather than static reports
Gap identification: Immediately highlights systematic policy gaps for strategic intervention
Best practice discovery: Reveals successful implementation models for replication

Impact: Traditional policy research of this scope would require months of manual data collection and analysis. AI collaboration enabled comprehensive national policy mapping in under an hour, with interactive analysis tools that support ongoing policy development.
